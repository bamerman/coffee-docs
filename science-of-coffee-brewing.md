# Science of coffee brewing 

A cup of coffee is simply coffee particles dissolved in water. In scientific terms, a cup of coffee is a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent).

The interaction between coffee particles and water is called **coffee brewing**. Despite involving only two ingredients, coffee brewing is a complex chemical process with many delicate variables.

This document explains the steps of coffee brewing and how these coffee brewing variables affect how coffee tastes. 

## Coffee brewing overview    
Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down coffee beans into smaller particles called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds. 
3. The resulting mixture of hot water and coffee grounds is filtered. 

**Brewing methods** 
You can perform the steps of the brewing process through a variety of **brewing methods**. Different brewing methods uniquely affect coffee brewing variables and change the way coffee tastes. Some common brewing methods include: 
- Drip:
- Pour over:
- French press:
