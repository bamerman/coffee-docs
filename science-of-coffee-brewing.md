# Science of coffee brewing 

A cup of coffee is a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent).

The process of making a cup of coffee is called **coffee brewing**. Despite involving only two ingredients, coffee brewing involves a complex reaction with many delicate variables.

In this document, you'll learn about coffee brewing and the variables that affect how coffee tastes. 

## Basics of coffee brewing     
Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down coffee beans into smaller particles called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds. 
3. A filter separates the coffee grounds from the resulting solution.  
 
You can brew coffee with a variety of **brewing methods**, which uniquely affect how coffee tastes. Some common brewing methods include: 
- The **drip** brewing method involves an automatic coffee maker dispensing hot water over a filter basket filled with coffee grounds. 
- The **pour over** brewing method involves manually pouring hot water over a funnel-shaped device lined with a paper filter. 
- The **french press** brewing method involves steeping coffee grounds in hot water for several minutes, then pressing a filter through the solution. 

## Variables 
Brewing coffee is simple, but brewing *good* coffee is not. Five variables interact with the coffee brewing process, which you'll learn about next. Even the slightest changes to these variables dramatically affect the way coffee tastes.

**Extraction**<br> 
**Grind size**<br> 
**Time**<br> 
**Temperature**<br> 
**Water quality**<br>
