# Science of coffee brewing 

A cup of coffee is simply particles of coffee dissolved in water. In scientific terms, a cup of coffee is a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent).

The interaction between coffee particles and water is called **coffee brewing**. Despite involving only two ingredients, coffee brewing is a complex chemical process with many delicate variables.

This document explains the basic steps of coffee brewing and the variables that affect how coffee tastes. 

## Basics     
Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down coffee beans into smaller particles called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds. 
3. The hot water and coffee grounds mixture is filtered. 

**Brewing methods**<br> 
You can perform the steps of the brewing process through a variety of **brewing methods**, which uniquely affect how coffee tastes. Some common brewing methods include: 
- **Drip**
- **Pour over**
- **French press**

## Variables 
**Strength**<br>
**Extraction**<br> 
**Grind size**<br> 
**Time**<br> 
**Temperature**<br> 
**Water quality**<br>
