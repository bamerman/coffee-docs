## What is coffee brewing   
**Coffee brewing** is the process of making a brewed coffee, a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent). 

Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down whole coffee beans into smaller fragments called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds and absorbs some of its content. 
3. A filter separates the hot water and absorbed coffee particles from the remaining coffee grounds.  
 
You can brew coffee with a variety of **brewing methods**, including: 
- **Drip** involves an automatic coffee maker dispensing hot water over a filter basket filled with coffee grounds. 
- **Pour over** involves manually pouring hot water over a funnel-shaped device lined with a paper filter. 
- **French press** involves steeping coffee grounds in hot water for several minutes, then pressing a filter through the solution. 

## Variables of coffee brewing 
Brewing coffee is simple, but brewing *good* coffee is not. The steps of coffee brewing involve five delicate variables that determine how brewed coffee tastes. The five variables of coffee brewing include: 

**Ratio**<br>
The amount of ground coffee per unit of water matters. More coffee per unit of water used while brewing makes more concentrated brewed coffee. To keep your brewing recipe consistent, use a scale to weigh out coffee and water in grams (g). 

**Grind size**<br>
The particle size of ground coffee matters. A **course grind** resists water, whereas a **fine grind** easily dissolves in water. Use a burr grinders for a uniform grind size. 

**Time**<br>
How long water contacts coffee grounds matters. The longer water is in contact with ground coffee, the more water dissolves and absorbs ground coffee. 

**Temperature:**<br> 
Water temperature matters. Hot water more aggressively dissolves and absorbs coffee grounds. Use filtered drinking water heated to 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit. 

**Water quality**<br>
The chemical makeup of water matters because:
- Acidic water dissolves coffee more aggressively than basic water does. 
- Water high in calcium and magnesium dissolves coffee more aggressiv

## Physical properties of brewed coffee 
But *how* do the variables of coffee brewing determine the taste of brewed coffee? 

Even the slightest changes to any of the brewing variables dramatically change the physical properties of brewed coffee, which include:

- **Strength** refers to the concentration of coffee particles per unit of water in brewed coffee. Important features of strength include: 
    - Brewed coffee generally tastes best at a concentration of 1 part coffee per 14 parts water.   
    - Coffee professionals accurately measure the strength of brewed coffee with a refractometer, which determines the **total dissolved solids (TDS)** in a solution.   
- **Extraction** refers to the percentage of coffee grounds that water dissolves, or extracts, into the brewed solution. Calculate extraction with this formula:
```
 Extraction [%] = (Weight of coffee grounds + water [g]) - Weight of brewed coffee [g] / Weight of coffee grounds + water [g]
```
Strength and extracton determine how brewed coffee tastes. To understand why, see the flavor map below for the flavors associated with different levels of strength and extraction.

## Putting it all together  
The flavor map shows that good-tasting brewed coffee depends on optimal levels of strength and extraction. 

To find optimal levels of strength and extracton for your coffee and preferences, use the flavor compass in these steps: 

1. **Find where your brew sits** on the flavor map. That spot is the center of the coffee compass.
2. **Optimize strength** according to the flavor compass: 
    - Use more coffee to make brewed coffee stronger.
    - Use less coffee to make brewed coffee weaker.
> **Tip:** To alter strength, fix water weight and adjust coffee dose. This will minimize the effects of other variables, such as brew time.

3. **Optimize extraction** according to the flavor compass: 
    - To extract more:
        - Make grind finer.
        - Extend brew time. 
    - To extract less:
        - Make grind courser.
        - Shorten brew time.   
> **Tip:** Use filtered drinking water heated to 195-200 degrees Fahrenheit.
