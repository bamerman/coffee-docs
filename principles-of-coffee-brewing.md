## What is coffee brewing   
**Coffee brewing** is the process of making a brewed coffee, a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent). 

Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down whole coffee beans into smaller fragments called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds, dissolving and absorbing some of its content. 
3. A filter separates the brewed solution from the remaining coffee grounds.  
 
You can brew coffee with a variety of **brewing methods**, including:
- **Drip:** Involves an automatic coffee maker dispensing hot water over a filter basket filled with coffee grounds. 
- **Pour over:** Involves manually pouring hot water over a funnel-shaped device lined with a paper filter. 
- **French press:** Involves steeping coffee grounds in hot water for several minutes, then pressing a filter through the solution. 

## Variables of coffee brewing 
Brewing coffee is simple, but brewing *good* coffee is not. The steps of coffee brewing involve five delicate variables that affect the way brewed coffee tastes. The five variables of coffee brewing are: 
- **Ratio:** Amount of ground coffee and water you use.
- **Grind size:** Courseness or fineness of your coffee grind. 
- **Time:** Amount of time water contacts the coffee grounds.
- **Temperature:** Temperature of your brewing water.   
- **Water quality:** Chemical makeup of your brewing water. 

The variables of coffee brewing affect the flavor of brewed coffee by changing its physical properties. The physical properties of coffee include:  

- **Strength:**<br>
Strength refers to how many dissolved particles of coffee exist per unit of water in brewed coffee. Important points about strength include: 
    - You can accurately measure strength with a refractometer, which finds the percentage of **total dissolved solids (TDS)** in brewed coffee.
    - Appealing brewed coffee generally sits at 10% TDS.   

- **Extraction:**<br>
Extraction refers to the percentage of coffee grounds that water actually dissolves, or **extracts**, into the resulting brew. Visualize extraction % with this formula:
```
brewed coffee / coffee grounds + water 
```

## Putting it all together  
The goal of coffee brewing is to use the coffee brewing variables to adjust strength and extraction for optimal flavor. With this in mind, brew appealing coffee with these steps: 

1. **Choose a brewing method:**
    - Drip 
    - Pour over 
    - French press 

3. **Start with the basics:** 
    - Use filtered drinking water heated to 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit. 
    - Choose a coarse grind for french press, a medium grind for pour over, and finer grind for drip. 
    - Aim for a brew time of 3-4 minutes. 

4. **Assess the brewed coffee:**<br>
Taste the brewed coffee and find where its flavor sits on the flavor map (figure 1). 

5. **Adjust strength:**
    - Use the flavor map to determine if the brewed coffee should be stronger or weaker. 
        - If stronger, 
        - If weaker, 

6. **Optimize strength** according to the flavor compass: 
    - Use more coffee to make brewed coffee stronger.
    - Use less coffee to make brewed coffee weaker.
> **Tip:** To alter strength, fix water weight and adjust coffee dose. This will minimize the effects of other variables, such as brew time.

3. **Optimize extraction** according to the flavor compass: 
    - To extract more:
        - Make grind finer.
        - Extend brew time. 
    - To extract less:
        - Make grind courser.
        - Shorten brew time.   
> **Tip:** Use filtered drinking water heated to 195-200 degrees Fahrenheit.
