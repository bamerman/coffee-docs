# Principles of coffee brewing  

A cup of coffee is a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent).

The process of making a cup of coffee is called **coffee brewing**. Despite involving only two ingredients, coffee brewing is a complex process with several delicate variables.

In this document, you'll learn about these features of coffee brewing:
-Basics 
-Variables 

## What coffee brewing is      
Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down coffee beans into smaller particles called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds. 
3. A filter separates the coffee grounds from the resulting solution.  
 
You can brew coffee with a variety of **brewing methods**, which uniquely affect how coffee tastes. Some common brewing methods include: 
- The **drip** brewing method involves an automatic coffee maker dispensing hot water over a filter basket filled with coffee grounds. 
- The **pour over** brewing method involves manually pouring hot water over a funnel-shaped device lined with a paper filter. 
- The **french press** brewing method involves steeping coffee grounds in hot water for several minutes, then pressing a filter through the solution. 

## Variables 
Five important variables are at play in the coffee brewing process:  

- **Ratio**: The ratio of coffee grounds to water affects coffee brewing. For now, know that this ratio-weight of coffee per unit of water-is called a **brewing recipe**. To keep brewing recipes consistent, baristas use scales to weigh out coffee and water in grams or ounces. 
- **Grind size:** The particle size of ground coffee affects brewing. For now, know that large **grind sizes** resist water, whereas small grind sizes easily dissolve in water. Because grind size is a major brewing variable, baristas invest in high-quality coffee grinders that ensure a uniform grind size. 
- **Time:** How long water and coffee contact each other affects brewing. For now, know that the longer water contacts coffee grounds, the more water dissolves the coffee grounds. 
- **Temperature:** Water temperature 
- **Water quality:** 

## Putting it all together 
Even the slightest changes to the brewing variables dramatically changes the physical properties of brewed coffee.

The physical properites of brewed coffee include: 

-**Strength**<br>
-**Total dissolved solids**<br>
-**Extraction**<br> 

The physical properties of brewed coffee determine how it tastes. Good brewed coffee consists of optimal levels of strength, TDS, and extraction. These optimal levels change according to origin, roast, and personal preference. To find a strength, TDS, and extraction that is right for you, use the brewed coffee compass below.
