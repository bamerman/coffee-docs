# About coffee docs 
The coffee docs respository houses documentation about coffee, including general knowledge, science, and equipment operations. At present, coffee docs primarily contains .md files; however, I'm adapting these files to .html for a future website. Find current coffee docs topics linked below. There is plenty more to add, so feel free to contribute!
