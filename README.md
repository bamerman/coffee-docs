# About coffee docs 
Coffee docs houses everything I've learned and documented about coffee, including general knowledge, science, and equipment operations. At present, coffee docs is a repository of .md files; however, I'm in the process of adapting these files to .html for a future website. Current coffee docs topics are linked below. There is plenty more to add, so feel free to contribute!
