# Barista training manual  
The goal of the barista training manual is to train new baristas in coffee knowledge and cafe operations. Although the manual targets new baristas, additional resources for experienced baristas supplement each section. In this manual, you'll learn about the following topics:

## Where coffee comes from 
Coffee comes from the seeds within the cherries of a coffee plant.

<a name="coffee-plants">**Coffee plants**</a><br> 
Coffee plants come in different **species** and **varietals** that produce coffee with unique sensory characteristics. **Coffea arabica** and **Coffea robusta** are the most common species of coffee plants, with Coffea arabaca being more sought after because of its superior aroma and flavor. The varietals of each species of coffee plant also affect the way coffee will taste. To learn more about coffee plants, see <a href="#species-and-varietals">species and varietals</a>. 

<a name="origin">**Origin**</a><br>
The place coffee is grown–its **origin**–also matters. Because coffee plants thrive in tropical climates, most coffee is grown in a ring of regions near the equator called the **coffee belt**. Each of the places within the coffee belt also affect the way coffee tastes, which is why coffee is often named after its origin. For example, *Sumatra* signals coffee that will taste earthy and zesty; *Ethiopa Yirgacheffe* signals sweet and floral. To learn more about origin, see <a href="#countries-and-regions">countries and regions</a>.

<a name="production">**Processing**</a><br>
Once a crop of coffee ripens, farmers pick the ripe cherries. Next, farmers must safely extract the coffee seeds from the cherries through a procdure called **processing**. The most common method of processing is **washed processing**, which works in these steps:  
1. The cherries pass through a de-pulper machine that removes the outer layer called the pulp.
2. The de-pulped cherries ferment in large vats until their mucilage layers detoriate.
3. Farmers rinse and agitate the fermented cherries to remove any remaining mucilage. 
4. Farmers dry and rake the cherries on raised cement beds.
5. The dry cherries pass through a mill that removes the skin and parchment layers. 
>For advanced information on processing, see [Other processing methods]().

What started as a cherry, is now a seed that resembles a coffee bean but paler. Freshly processed coffee is called green coffee, and it must go through one last production stage before it resembles the coffee you're familiar wiht and is ready to be made into a delicious cup of coffee.  
**Roasting**
Coffee roasting refers to the cooking of green coffee beans to release their full flavor potential. Coffee roasting is very complex and nuanced, but these are the most important things you need to know:
