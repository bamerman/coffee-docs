# Basics of coffee brewing 

A cup of coffee is a solution comprised of coffee particles (the solute) and water (the solvent).

The process of making a cup of coffee is called **coffee brewing**. Despite involving only two ingredients, coffee brewing involves a complex reaction with many delicate variables.

In this document, you'll learn about coffee brewing and the variables that affect how coffee tastes. 

## Overview     
Brewing coffee involves three simple steps: 
1. A coffee grinder breaks down coffee beans into smaller particles called **coffee grounds**. 
2. Hot water contacts the coffee grounds. 
3. A filter separates the coffee grounds from the resulting solution.  
 
You can brew coffee with a variety of **brewing methods**, which uniquely affect how coffee tastes. Some common brewing methods include: 
- The **drip** brewing method involves an automatic coffee maker dispensing hot water over a filter basket filled with coffee grounds. 
- The **pour over** brewing method involves manually pouring hot water over a funnel-shaped device lined with a paper filter. 
- The **french press** brewing method involves steeping coffee grounds in hot water for several minutes, then pressing a filter through the solution. 

## Variables 
Brewing coffee is simple, but brewing *good* coffee is not. Five variables affect the coffee brewing process. Even the slightest changes to these variables dramatically affect the way coffee tastes. 

The major variables of coffee brewing are: 

- **Ratio**<br> 
The ratio of coffee grounds to water affects how coffee tastes. In coffee brewing, this ratio–the amount of coffee grams per unit of water– is called a **brewing recipe**. To keep brewing recipes consistent, baristas use scales to measure coffee and water in grams and ounces. 
- **Grind size**<br> 
The particle size of ground coffee also affects how coffee tastes. Large **grind sizes** resist water; small grind sizes easily dissolve in water. Because grind size is a major brewing variable, baristas invest in high-quality coffee grinders that ensure a uniform grind size. 
- **Time**<br> 
- **Temperature**<br> 
- **Water quality**<br> 

## Putting it all together 
But *how* do the variables of coffee brewing affect the way coffee tastes? 

To answer this, you must understand how the brewing variables change these features of a brewed cup of coffee:

-**Strength**<br>
-**Total dissolved solids**<br>
-**Extraction**<br>
